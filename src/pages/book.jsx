      Research has shown that reading fiction helps us develop empathy and
      critical thinking. Bonus: it can also be incredibly fun and make the hours
      fly by. Why not hit your local library and pick out a new page-turner, or
      dive into an old classic thatâ€™s been on your list for years?
