      We know exercise is good for us, but when we mix it with a little bit of
      fun, the effects on our physical and mental wellbeing can be incredible!
      The options are endless â€“ you could give frisbee a go, challenge a friend
      to a game of swing ball, play fetch with your furry friend, or anything
      that strikes your fancy.
